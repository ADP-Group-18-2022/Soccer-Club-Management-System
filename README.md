# Soccer-Club-Management-System

##Problem Domain
Super Strikers is a small soccer team based in Cape Town. The team was playing for non-established local league, but with the help of investors 
the team has been promoted to cape town's premier league division. Super strikers' soccer team store the team's information of all stakeholders on a 
paper-based system. The capturing of data manually takes time and the process of searching for a particular record is often error prone. 
There is also a chance of misplacing the documents/records of the team. The team wishes to have an automated system to manage the data of the team since 
the team will be expanding due to the promotion into the new league. The system must accommodate all related stakeholders, and all data will have to be 
captured in a reliable and efficient manner. The information needs to be stored safely and needs to be accessible easily.
